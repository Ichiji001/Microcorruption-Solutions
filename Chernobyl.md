Chernobyl
--------------------------

This program uses hash maps to store password information and I found it quite challenging. But nonetheless, luck prevailed. \*cough\* (skill)

Step 1: <b><br>
This program asks the user to input a username and password in a single line, in a certain format. That format is: 'access [your name] [pin]'. It's pretty strange for a user login to require a command field, and perhaps there are more commands than access.

Step 2: <b><br>
And... Yes there are other commands, just by looking in the run function there are two compares that are done, one for an 'a' and one for an 'n'. 

Step 2: <b><br>
Try making some user accounts and observe where they are stored...
